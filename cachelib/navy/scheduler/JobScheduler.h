//
// Job has a movable function returning JobExitCode:
//   - Done           Job finished
//   - Reschedule     Re-queue and retry again
//
// JobScheduler has the following members:
//   - enqueue(Job)               Enqueues a job
//   - enqueueWithKey(Job, key)   Enqueues a job with a key. Can be used to hash
//                                jobs.
//   - finish()                   Waits for all the scheduled jobs to finish
